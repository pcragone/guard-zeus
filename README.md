Install
-------

Please be sure to have [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) and [Zeus](https://github.com/burke/zeus) installed before continuing.

Install the gem:

    $ gem install guard-zeus

Add it to your Gemfile (inside development group):

``` ruby
gem 'guard-zeus'
```

Add guard definition to your Guardfile by running this command:

    $ guard init zeus

Usage
-----

Please read [Guard usage doc](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme)

Guardfile
---------

Please read [Guard doc](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme) for more information about the Guardfile DSL.

### Options

Available options:

``` ruby
:cli => '--time'         # Pass options to zeus. `zeus commands` for more zeus options
```

Known Issues
------------


### Use with pry

There is a known issue when using guard-zeus with pry, notably the zeus output appear on top of the pry console.

The workaround is to add the `cli` setting in your `Guardfile`, e.g.

```
guard 'zeus', cli: '> /dev/null' do
```

### Lingering zeus process

If you have issues with `zeus` lingering around after exiting `guard`, you can
add the following to the top of your `Guardfile`.

```
at_exit {exec('pkill -f zeus')}
```
